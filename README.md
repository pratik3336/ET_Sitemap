# ET_Sitemap

This sitemap was developed in my internship in Indian Institute Of Technology Mumbai .
The www.et.iitb.ac.in is the official website of the Educational Technology department at IIT Bombay. This website showcases multiple labs that facilitate research and development of Educational Technology. 

The ET IITB website shows the collaborative research and development work by Ph.D. research scholars in emerging technology areas, as well as showcases state-of-the-art infrastructure like Virtual Reality HMDs, 3D printers, physical computing devices and high-end workstations.

  
Hence, to improve the SEO reach of the website, and also to make the website more accessible and more user friendly, development of Plugins, Sitemaps and Heatmaps is proposed and developed. These programs integrated into the website will not only improve the SEO ranking of this site but also improve the basic architecture and working of the site as well.



 This sitemap is created in XML. Now that the XML sitemap has been created, it’s time to submit it to Google through Search Console. Here’s how you can do that in a few easy steps:
 
1. Sign into Google Search Console and click “Sitemaps” in the left sidebar

2. Add the URL of your sitemap at the top of the page where it says “Add a new sitemap”

3. Click submit and Google will crawl your newly created XML sitemap.

*(FOR THIS THE PERMISSION FROM ET SITE ADMIN IS REQUIRED)*
